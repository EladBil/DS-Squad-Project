- We analyze the dataset: many medical features.
- In addition we make acomplete analysis of the missing values and build methods to deal with them.
- We made few methods for preprocessing data and get cleaner and more understanable dataset for executing model.
- We choose to use XGBoost classifier to predict if a given patient will died at hospital or not: this information can be useful for medical personel to know when a patient arrive and after checking all basis medical measure our model can predict if the patient is likely to died or not and if he is so the doctors can agree to a adapted cares, hospital unit, possible surgeries and more.
- We decided to build a model which is sensitive to data where he is likely to predict more death in order that doctors will be more focus on patients that have a possible danger of death even if it s not high.


**Run the project**: clone all the repository, install necessary module (requirement.txt) and run the final notebook.
